## 🧠 About Me  
I’m passionate about learning and experimenting with AI & ML. I explore areas like time series forecasting, predictive modeling, computer vision, and NLP. I build small projects to challenge myself, improve continuously, and eventually create AI solutions that feel natural and useful.

- 🔍 Focus areas: predictive models, computer vision, data-driven systems  
- 📈 Always growing — iterating on what I build and what I learn  
- 🎯 Goal: turn curiosity into projects that matter
